- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @buttsnutefrosk, (latin: Rana temporaria), one of two frog species native to Norway. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an aquatic species interested in data flow and waterway architecture. Waterfall processes are a bit heavy to me, though, so I prefer being more agile.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning jumping out of waterfilled kettles before they become too hot.
